The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Cinzano Rosso Sweet Vermouth": {"description": "A blend of high quality red wine and essences of herbs and spices, creating a delicate and balanced refreshing drink, a slight sweetness balances with herbal bitterness.

And approach this drink with a strong nerve and steel resolve. The Kraken Black Spiced Rum is a notable import from Trinidad and Tobago, so named for the squid-like sea monster of myth and legend. It's a dark spiced Caribbean rum in an old-style bottle that will make anyone channel their inner pirate and sing yo-ho-ho.\n\nKraken Rum was introduced in 2010. Its base rum is distilled in Trinidad from sweet molasses made from locally-sourced sugarcane. The rum is then aged one to two years and blended with The Kraken's mix of special spices, which includes clove, ginger and cinnamon. When held up to the light in a glass, the rum is black with subtle brown hints.\n\nMany are drawn to The Kraken Black Spiced Rum for the bottle, which is styled after a classic Victorian rum bottle. The bottle features two hoop handles that would have been used to hang the container and prevent breakages.\n\nThe best thing about The Kraken is its depth of flavors. As with any drink, the aroma is what hits you first. The Kraken boasts a nutty scent with coffee, vanilla, cherryade and gunpowder, immediately setting the tone for a wonderful sensory experience. As for the taste, the spiced rum is almost cola-like in its vanilla-style spice. Slightly sweet, The Kraken offers hints of espresso coffee, cinnamon, creamy caramel, cloves and gingerbread. All this gives way to a long, peppery finish, which perfectly sums up the rum's spiciness. It's a satisfying, drinkable rum with a broad appeal.\n\nSo, how do you drink The Kraken? We suggest enjoying The Kraken on the rocks in a nice tumbler. If you prefer to mix your own cocktails, The Kraken will not disappoint! Use it to make a Dark and Stormy, which is just black spiced rum and ginger beer. Another good option is The Perfect Storm, which blends The Kraken, ginger beer, Angostura bitters, sugar syrup and lime over ice. You also can't beat the classic Rum and Coke.\n\nBuy The Kraken Rum online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/rum/spiced-rum/the-kraken-black-spiced-rum/p229", "categories": ["Liquor", "Rum", "Spiced Rum"]}, "DeKuyper Blue Curacao Liqueur": {"description": "Elementary and world famous, DeKuyper\u00ae Blue Curacao Liqueur is a solid basis for creating classic cocktails.

The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor.

Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\n\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass.

He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks.

Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\n\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out.

In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean. Thanks to these ingredients, the flavor profile evokes visions of white sand beaches, palm trees and crystal-clear ocean waters.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}}, "Cheerleader Champagne Cocktail": {"url": "https://drizly.com/cheerleader-champagne-cocktail/r-982723a3232d4b4a", "description": "A sparkling cocktail that mixes berry goodness with your favorite bubbly.

Scharffenberger Brut is made from its own 120-acre vineyards in the Anderson Valley. In addition, Scharffenberger Cellars has long-term contracts with select vineyards in the greater Mendocino County. This type of vineyard selection allows us to choose from the best vineyards in the area which enables us to produce our trademark cuv\u00e9e.    The wine is two-thirds Pinot Noir which produces a red fruit (cherry and plum) forward nose combined with one-third Chardonnay which adds the tropical expression of litchi nut and mango. The 100% malolactic fermentation adds a vanilla cream character producing a round and full-bodied wine. After approximately two years on the yeast lees, there are notes of freshly baked bread and pastry that enhances the more fruit forward style of the wine.

This is an important question for the makers of Bailey's Irish Cream. Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \n\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\n\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\n\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

The drink was first produced in the 1980s, and over the years, it slowly became popular in Canada and outside the country.\n\nWhen it was first made, Fireball was one of Seagram's several flavored schnapps drinks. In 1989, Sazerac\u00a0Company purchased the rights to the formula and the brand from Seagram. At first, Sazerac branded this as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky. It wasn't until years later in 2007 that the drink was re-branded to the Fireball Cinnamon Whisky most people now recognize.\n\nThe flavor of Fireball is unlike anything else. Even other cinnamon whiskies are difficult to compare. The drink goes down smooth, and as the branding will have you know, it's fiery. It's warming in the belly and flavorful on the tongue. You'll get the flavor of a cinnamon candy with all the spicy and sweet tones that you've always loved.\n\nThere are a ton of ways to drink Fireball Whisky, depending on your mood and preferences. If you're in the mood for the whisky itself, you can take it as a shot or drink it on the rocks. For many, however, the strong flavor of Fireball is hard to take straight. Luckily, there are so many outstanding mixed drinks you can make with Fireball that you'll have tons of options to choose from.\n\nEnhance your cider drink with Fireball. Add a shot of Fireball to a pint of your favorite hard cider for an awesome cinnamon taste. The most commonly suggested cider for this drink is Angry Orchard Crisp Apple Cider, but any cider will work.\n\nTry a mixed shot for something a little different. Combine Fireball and coffee liqueur in a shot glass for a spicy coffee flavor. If you're in the mood for a fizzy drink, combine one part Fireball and three parts Dr. Pepper for a Hot Pepper. The fireball helps bring out all the other flavors in the soda, making it a fun drink.\n\nBuy Fireball Cinnamon Whisky online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/whiskey/flavored-whiskey/fireball-cinnamon-whisky/p3343", "categories": ["Liquor", "Whiskey", "Flavored Whiskey "]}, "RumChata Horchata Con Ron Cream Liqueur": {"description": "When you want to get the party started, make RumChata your go-to.

An authentic silver tequila, Especial Silver is masterfully balanced to bring out its caramel, agave and herbal tones.\n\nEven if you're new to silver tequila, you've heard the name Jose Cuervo. The company boasts the largest agave holdings on the planet. Jose Cuervo agave is nestled in rich, volcanic soil and allowed to grow for seven years to reach maturity. After harvesting and pruning, the agave is sent to the famous La Roje\u00f1a distillery, which has been around since 1812. Each day, the oven deck at La Roje\u00f1a receives up to 300 tons of agave to produce Jose Cuervo tequila.\n\nUnlike most of Jose Cuervo's tequilas, Especial Silver remains unaged and contains at least 51 percent agave. The remaining liquid consists of sugarcane spirit. It's bottled immediately after distillation to maintain its pleasantly balanced aromas. The taste is light and mild, showcasing a blend of acidity and sweetness, which allows for easy drinking and mixing. \n\nSince Jose Cuervo Especial Silver has a clean, light taste, it's great for shots, especially if you want to follow it up with a chaser. The best way to enjoy Especial Silver, however, is in a cocktail.

Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick's Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\n\nHendrick's is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick's as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\n\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\n\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets.

The result is a flowery and fruity aroma that lends itself to a diverse mix of flavors. If only most brothers could put their minds to such good use instead of fighting!\n\nFull and fleshy on the tongue, Lillet Blanc offers a mishmash of tastes including candied oranges, honey and pine resin. At 17 percent ABV, it's a bit stronger than most wines, but without being classified as a fortified wine.\n\nLillet Blanc is the classy drink that many people don't know exists. It's an excellent choice for a pre-dinner beverage, making a toast or paired with brunch. Drinking it on the rocks can bring out all the exotic fruits that go into its production, while an orange garnish adds a splash of color to the mix.\n\nWhile Lillet Blanc is terrific on the rocks, the Vesper is a real show stopper.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor.

It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\n\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\n\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older a\u00f1ejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\n\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\n\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/tequila/reposado-tequila/hornitos-reposado-tequila/p4506", "categories": ["Liquor", "Tequila", "Reposado Tequila"]}, "Fever Tree Ginger Beer": {"description": "By brewing a blend of three gingers from Nigeria, Cochin and the Ivory Coast, Fever Tree has created an award winning ginger beer that has been highly acclaimed by gastronomes and critics alike.

The drink was first produced in the 1980s, and over the years, it slowly became popular in Canada and outside the country.\n\nWhen it was first made, Fireball was one of Seagram's several flavored schnapps drinks. In 1989, Sazerac\u00a0Company purchased the rights to the formula and the brand from Seagram. At first, Sazerac branded this as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky. It wasn't until years later in 2007 that the drink was re-branded to the Fireball Cinnamon Whisky most people now recognize.\n\nThe flavor of Fireball is unlike anything else. Even other cinnamon whiskies are difficult to compare. The drink goes down smooth, and as the branding will have you know, it's fiery. It's warming in the belly and flavorful on the tongue. You'll get the flavor of a cinnamon candy with all the spicy and sweet tones that you've always loved.\n\nThere are a ton of ways to drink Fireball Whisky, depending on your mood and preferences. If you're in the mood for the whisky itself, you can take it as a shot or drink it on the rocks. For many, however, the strong flavor of Fireball is hard to take straight. Luckily, there are so many outstanding mixed drinks you can make with Fireball that you'll have tons of options to choose from.\n\nEnhance your cider drink with Fireball. Add a shot of Fireball to a pint of your favorite hard cider for an awesome cinnamon taste. The most commonly suggested cider for this drink is Angry Orchard Crisp Apple Cider, but any cider will work.\n\nTry a mixed shot for something a little different. Combine Fireball and coffee liqueur in a shot glass for a spicy coffee flavor. If you're in the mood for a fizzy drink, combine one part Fireball and three parts Dr. Pepper for a Hot Pepper. The fireball helps bring out all the other flavors in the soda, making it a fun drink.\n\nBuy Fireball Cinnamon Whisky online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/whiskey/flavored-whiskey/fireball-cinnamon-whisky/p3343", "categories": ["Liquor", "Whiskey", "Flavored Whiskey "]}}, "Fireside": {"url": "https://drizly.com/fireside/r-229c7ac1b2129e31", "description": "<p>A refreshing grapefruit cocktail with a wintery addition of rosemary and maple syrup, the Fireside will keep you aglow all season long.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>", "recipeIngredient": ["4 parts Grey Goose Vodka\n", "5 parts Pink Grapefruit Juice", "1 part No. 2 Organic Maple Syrup", "2 sprigs Rosemary (remove the leaves of one sprig)", "Pinch of Salt"], "name": "Fireside", "recipeInstructions": "In the bottle of a rocks glass, crush rosemary leaves into the maple syrup and salt.

The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable \u2013\u00a0just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

While you're not going to get cavities with your first sip, it offers a balance between the agave flavor and a sweetness. There is little to no aftertaste, making this a great option for mixing or drinking by itself.\n\nOne of the best things about Milagro Silver Tequila is that it goes down smooth and doesn't burn like many other tequilas out there. However, there is a strong smell so if you have trouble with the scent of agave, you might want to plug your nose.\n\nTequila is made from the blue agave plant and is distilled for varying amounts of time, depending on the type of tequila and the maker's preference. According to the laws in Mexico, tequila is only allowed to be produced in and around Jalisco, and select other areas. While the alcohol content can range between 31 percent and 55 percent alcohol content, it generally sits around 38 percent.\n\nWhile you can drink this tequila by itself, it also pairs well with a huge variety of other drinks to give you outstanding cocktails.\n\nGo for something classic with a margarita. Combine two parts Milagro Silver, three-quarters parts agave nectar or simple syrup and one-part lime juice for a refreshing drink. Another great standard tequila drink to try is the tequila sunrise. Mix one-part tequila, one-third part grenadine and two-thirds part orange juice.\n\nBuy Milagro Silver Tequila online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/tequila/silver-tequila/milagro-silver-tequila/p1280", "categories": ["Liquor", "Tequila", "Silver / Blanco Tequila"]}, "Montelobos Mezcal Joven": {"description": "Montelobos is an artisanal mezcal made in Santiago Matatl\u00e1n Oaxaca produced with 100% organically certified agave espad\u00edn.

Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick's Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\n\nHendrick's is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick's as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\n\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\n\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon's Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper.

Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"j\u00e4ger\"), it's the ideal drink to mark every big win \u2014 or even a well-deserved weekend. J\u00e4ger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\n\nA true classic, the J\u00e4germeister recipe hasn't changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenb\u00fcttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it's mixed with sugar and alcohol before it's bottled and shipped right to your front door.\n\nEven the J\u00e4germeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle.

You should put it right up there with the best names from Tennessee, Ireland, Canada or Scotland. It's a great dessert after a grilled steak and is at home with a cigar next to your ash tray.\n\nHow does it mix? Its bold, organic flavor stands up well in cocktails if you must mix it. Fresh mint and a hint of sugar make a fine Julep. It makes a nice old fashioned with orange, bitters and a cherry. The family suggests you try a new fashioned. Instead of sugar, use Amaretto as a sweetener. Mix that with bitters and an orange peel. Serve it up or on the rocks.\n\nWhatever you do, taste it with a little extra patience. It spent nine long years getting to you. Don't rush it.\n\nBuy Knob Creek Bourbon Whiskey online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\n\nWinner of Double Gold Medal at the 2017 San Francisco World Spirits Competition", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/whiskey/bourbon/knob-creek-kentucky-straight-bourbon-whiskey/p1193", "categories": ["Liquor", "Whiskey", "Bourbon"]}, "ReaLime Lime Juice": {"description": "ReaLime Lime Juice From Concentrate is 100 percent natural-strength juice made from fresh, quality limes.

The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable \u2013\u00a0just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass.

The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Martini & Rossi Rosso Sweet Vermouth": {"description": "Fortified wine from Italy that is distilled with a combination of more than 30 herbs and spices including sage, coriander, allspice, and Roman camomile.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable \u2013\u00a0just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Forty Creek Barrel Select": {"description": "Robust vanilla, caramel and roasted walnuts hit your nose as medium bodied toffee, white pepper and bold spice hit your lips.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor.

In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean. Thanks to these ingredients, the flavor profile evokes visions of white sand beaches, palm trees and crystal-clear ocean waters. Even if you can only fill a kiddie pool to sit in, Bacardi Superior Rum takes you away from it all.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/rum/white-rum/bacardi-superior-rum/p1804", "categories": ["Liquor", "Rum", "White Rum"]}, "St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur": {"description": "Creating spirits is a labor of love, but few other liqueurs have such a laborious process. To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor.

It tastes delicious in mixed drinks and will introduce you to the world of mezcal.\n\nThis mezcal is distilled twice and hand-crafted. Del Maguey uses wood-fired copper stills, which bring out fruity aromas and other sweet notes such as honey and vanilla. On your palate, experience cinnamon, banana, tangerine and even sandalwood.\n\nWondering why you should opt for mezcal over tequila? Both mezcal and tequila are Mexican liquors distilled from the agave plant. Mezcal and tequila come from different regions in Mexico and often from different varieties of agave plant. Tequila must come from the Blue Agave plant, while mezcal can come from any agave plant. Most mezcal comes from Agave Espadin, including the Del Maguey Vida variety.\n\nThough you can try sipping Del Maguey Vida Mezcal to understand what mezcal is and how it should taste, this mezcal is designed to taste delicious in cocktails. The fruit notes and long finish make it perfect for fruitier mixes, such as a Sierra Madre Sunrise, which is made of mezcal plus Aperol, chocolate bitters and lemon juice. Try making a Mezcal Julep with basil and cranberry for a fruity twist on the classic.

This is an important question for the makers of Bailey's Irish Cream. Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \n\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\n\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\n\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Prairie Organic Gin": {"description": "Bursts of herbs, sage, juniper and exotic spices, complementing a dry and refreshing taste with a long, delicate finish.

Originally, Boissiere was a French brand of vermouth made in the Chamb\u00e9ry region; in 1971, seeking a new home, the brand relocated to the other side of Mont Blanc to Turin, Italy. So, this vermouth can claim two of the \u201ccapitols\u201d of vermouth as it home. Vermouth begins with a neutral, dry white wine (generally) which is then blended with an eau de vie that has been infused with a special selection of herbs, flowers, fruit peels, seeds, plants and whatever botanicals are needed to achieve its specific and distinct attributes. The addition of the eau de vie infused with the 'singular botanical recipe' into the wine makes vermouth an 'aromatized'-'fortified' wine. With sweet vermouth, caramelized sugar is then added to achieve desired sweetness and color. In Boissiere, the aromas start at clean flowers, marjoram, coriander, citrus, chamomile, cake, clove, herbal and hints of nutmeg. The flavor articulately follows the aromas awash in a well integrated sweetness. All of this leads to a lean, fresh finish.

It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\n\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\n\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older a\u00f1ejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\n\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\n\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/tequila/reposado-tequila/hornitos-reposado-tequila/p4506", "categories": ["Liquor", "Tequila", "Reposado Tequila"]}, "Campari": {"description": "For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Martini & Rossi Rosso Sweet Vermouth": {"description": "Fortified wine from Italy that is distilled with a combination of more than 30 herbs and spices including sage, coriander, allspice, and Roman camomile.

The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick's as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\n\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\n\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Martini & Rossi Rosso Sweet Vermouth": {"description": "Fortified wine from Italy that is distilled with a combination of more than 30 herbs and spices including sage, coriander, allspice, and Roman camomile.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Gallo Sweet Vermouth": {"description": "Italy- A blend of sweet wines and natural ingredients are combined to create this lightly sweet aperitif.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/herbal-spice-liqueur/st-germain-elderflower-liqueur/p4832", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps", "Herbal & Spice Liqueur"]}}, "Spiced Caramel Apple Hot Toddy": {"url": "https://drizly.com/spiced_caramel_apple_hot_toddy/r-02d4e359f1e6963b", "description": "This spiced caramel apple hot toddy is the perfect fall drink combining warm spices with sweet caramel and apples to create the ultimate cocktail for all season long.&nbsp; With a little bourbon kick, this drink is sure to keep your blood warm and the ghosts and goblins away!", "recipeIngredient": ["3 Oz.

He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\n\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean.

This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\n\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older a\u00f1ejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\n\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks.

The result is a flowery and fruity aroma that lends itself to a diverse mix of flavors. If only most brothers could put their minds to such good use instead of fighting!\n\nFull and fleshy on the tongue, Lillet Blanc offers a mishmash of tastes including candied oranges, honey and pine resin. At 17 percent ABV, it's a bit stronger than most wines, but without being classified as a fortified wine.\n\nLillet Blanc is the classy drink that many people don't know exists. It's an excellent choice for a pre-dinner beverage, making a toast or paired with brunch. Drinking it on the rocks can bring out all the exotic fruits that go into its production, while an orange garnish adds a splash of color to the mix.\n\nWhile Lillet Blanc is terrific on the rocks, the Vesper is a real show stopper.

The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Martini & Rossi Rosso Sweet Vermouth": {"description": "Fortified wine from Italy that is distilled with a combination of more than 30 herbs and spices including sage, coriander, allspice, and Roman camomile.

Aside from leading a revolution and discovering electricity, Franklin was an avid agriculturalist and best friend of botanist John Bartram. In fact, Franklin brought the first rhubarb seeds from Europe to America as a gift for Mr. Bartram in 1771. (Bartram\u2019s Garden in Philadelphia is America\u2019s oldest botanical garden. If you haven\u2019t visited, you really should.) Point in fact, rhubarb originally came from China, where it was used as an herbal tonic. In the late 18th century, cane sugar became more affordable, which changed the way rhubarb was enjoyed.    Upon discovering the capacity of sugar to release the wonders of the plant\u2019s intrinsic flavor, rhubarb migrated from a fold tonic to a tasty treat. Legend has it, Bartram was so enthused with rhubarb, he concocted a lovely garden tea showcasing his new botanical prize. We were mulling over this story when we came up with the idea of creating our own Art in the Age garden spirit in Mr. Bartram\u2019s honor.    We are proud to offer you RHUBARB Tea! RHUBARB Tea features a botanical bounty of beets, carrots, lemons, petitgrain, cardamom, pure cane sugar, and of course, Bartram\u2019s prize rhubarb. All organically certified and delicious. A confident 80 proof spirit that\u2019s tangy but not too tangy\u2013sweet, but not too sweet. Crisp and refreshing, but with a hint of spice.

While the label is owned by Spring 44 Distilling Company, the filing with the federal Tax and Trade Bureau (as of 2012) locates the source as the Temperance Distilling Company of Michigan, which we have noted here as the producer.

Spring 44 Vodka is made from what they describe as a \"proprietary blend of American-grown grain.\" It is filtered through a special \"virgin coconut\" carbon (charcoal) process (we don't quite know what a \"virgin\" coconut is--is there a \"sullied\" coconut?--but guess it suggests not having been used in any other filtation process). They note that there is not one drop of \"munipal\" water in the vodka but 100% Rocky Mountain artesian water.    Spring 44 Honey Vodka is their flavored version, using \"all natural botanicals.\" It presents as a pale gold in the bottle.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\n \nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\n\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\n\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\n\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\n\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\n\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/liqueur/campari/p2341", "categories": ["Liquor", "Liqueur, Cordials, & Schnapps"]}, "Dolin Dry Vermouth": {"description": "Dolin Vermouths are notably lighter, drier and less pungent than their larger commercial counterparts.

The perfect inspiration for your own ingenious cocktails, mix our award-winning London Dry Gin with a splash of premium tonic water in a coupe glass and a wedge of lime for a classic and refreshing tasting gin and tonic.\n\nTanqueray was developed over 180 years ago by Charles Tanqueray, a clergyman's son who chose not to follow the family calling and instead opened a distillery in Bloomsbury, London. Not afraid to mix up brave ideas in his own unique style, he invented a gin which is still celebrated to this day. The perfect mix of ingenuity, heritage and hard work, Tanqueray is a dry, crisp gin with a rich juniper flavor that makes the most refreshing tasting gin and tonics and the driest of martini cocktails", "url": "https://drizly.com//liquor/gin/london-dry-gin/tanqueray-london-dry-gin/p146", "categories": ["Liquor", "Gin", "London Dry Gin"]}, "Schweppes Club Soda": {"description": "Schweppe's original club soda makes an outstanding mixer!

All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\n\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\n\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable \u2013\u00a0just not in a predictable way.\n\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\n\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\n\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\n\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\n\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\n\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.
