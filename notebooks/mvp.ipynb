The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

The Kraken Black Spiced Rum is a notable import from Trinidad and Tobago, so named for the squid-like sea monster of myth and legend. It's a dark spiced Caribbean rum in an old-style bottle that will make anyone channel their inner pirate and sing yo-ho-ho.\\n\\nKraken Rum was introduced in 2010. Its base rum is distilled in Trinidad from sweet molasses made from locally-sourced sugarcane. The rum is then aged one to two years and blended with The Kraken's mix of special spices, which includes clove, ginger and cinnamon. When held up to the light in a glass, the rum is black with subtle brown hints.\\n\\nMany are drawn to The Kraken Black Spiced Rum for the bottle, which is styled after a classic Victorian rum bottle. The bottle features two hoop handles that would have been used to hang the container and prevent breakages.\\n\\nThe best thing about The Kraken is its depth of flavors. As with any drink, the aroma is what hits you first. The Kraken boasts a nutty scent with coffee, vanilla, cherryade and gunpowder, immediately setting the tone for a wonderful sensory experience. As for the taste, the spiced rum is almost cola-like in its vanilla-style spice. Slightly sweet, The Kraken offers hints of espresso coffee, cinnamon, creamy caramel, cloves and gingerbread. All this gives way to a long, peppery finish, which perfectly sums up the rum's spiciness. It's a satisfying, drinkable rum with a broad appeal.\\n\\nSo, how do you drink The Kraken? We suggest enjoying The Kraken on the rocks in a nice tumbler. If you prefer to mix your own cocktails, The Kraken will not disappoint! Use it to make a Dark and Stormy, which is just black spiced rum and ginger beer. Another good option is The Perfect Storm, which blends The Kraken, ginger beer, Angostura bitters, sugar syrup and lime over ice. You also can't beat the classic Rum and Coke.\\n\\nBuy The Kraken Rum online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order.

       "  'St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur': {'description': \"Creating spirits is a labor of love, but few other liqueurs have such a laborious process. To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick\\'s as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\\n\\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\\n\\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets.

He became the first to export tequila to the rest of the world, and today, Sauza offers a full line of tequila. Sauza® Silver, one of the pioneer spirits from the brand, is double distilled in copper pot stills at low proof to retain the full agave flavor.

Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \\n\\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick. Bailey's is an infinitely usable bar pantry ingredient you should always have around.

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable –\\xa0just not in a predictable way.\\n\\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\\n\\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\\n\\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\\n\\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\\n\\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\\n\\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \\n\\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

Scharffenberger Brut is made from its own 120-acre vineyards in the Anderson Valley. In addition, Scharffenberger Cellars has long-term contracts with select vineyards in the greater Mendocino County. This type of vineyard selection allows us to choose from the best vineyards in the area which enables us to produce our trademark cuvée.    The wine is two-thirds Pinot Noir which produces a red fruit (cherry and plum) forward nose combined with one-third Chardonnay which adds the tropical expression of litchi nut and mango. The 100% malolactic fermentation adds a vanilla cream character producing a round and full-bodied wine. After approximately two years on the yeast lees, there are notes of freshly baked bread and pastry that enhances the more fruit forward style of the wine. Finally, after several months on the cork the wine develops caramel and hazel complexors.',\n",

Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

       "  'St-Germain Elderflower Liqueur': {'description': \"Creating spirits is a labor of love, but few other liqueurs have such a laborious process. To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

       "  'Bacardi Superior Rum': {'description': \"Bacardi Superior is Bacardi's flagship rum and the one that started it all way back in 1862. In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\\n\\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean. Thanks to these ingredients, the flavor profile evokes visions of white sand beaches, palm trees and crystal-clear ocean waters. Even if you can only fill a kiddie pool to sit in, Bacardi Superior Rum takes you away from it all.\",\n",

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

The wine is approximately two-thirds Pinot Noir and one-third Chardonnay and undergoes 100% malolactic fermentation. Scharffenberger Brut is made from its own 120-acre vineyards in the Anderson Valley. In addition, Scharffenberger Cellars has long-term contracts with select vineyards in the greater Mendocino County. This type of vineyard selection allows us to choose from the best vineyards in the area which enables us to produce our trademark cuvée.    The wine is two-thirds Pinot Noir which produces a red fruit (cherry and plum) forward nose combined with one-third Chardonnay which adds the tropical expression of litchi nut and mango. The 100% malolactic fermentation adds a vanilla cream character producing a round and full-bodied wine. After approximately two years on the yeast lees, there are notes of freshly baked bread and pastry that enhances the more fruit forward style of the wine. Finally, after several months on the cork the wine develops caramel and hazel complexors.',\n",

Created from a unique blend of luscious currant berries and spirits, Hiram Walker Crème de Cassis is deep red and delicious. This liqueur is typically featured in cocktails alongside vermouth, white wine, or soda water; it's also used in a popular French cocktail called the Kir Royale, an aperitif made with Crème de Cassis and champagne. Hiram Walker started producing spirits in 1858, and pioneered numerous distillation and manufacturing processes that are now industry standards. For example, Hiram Walker was one of the first alcohol producers to begin placing labels on bottles. Crème de Cassis is a great choice to round out your bar essentials. For a dash of color and sweetness, we recommend serving it with white wine or champagne.\",\n",

Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \\n\\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick. Bailey's is an infinitely usable bar pantry ingredient you should always have around. Don’t wait, buy Bailey’s Original Irish Cream through Drizly at a great price and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

The drink was first produced in the 1980s, and over the years, it slowly became popular in Canada and outside the country.\\n\\nWhen it was first made, Fireball was one of Seagram's several flavored schnapps drinks. In 1989, Sazerac\\xa0Company purchased the rights to the formula and the brand from Seagram. At first, Sazerac branded this as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky. It wasn't until years later in 2007 that the drink was re-branded to the Fireball Cinnamon Whisky most people now recognize.\\n\\nThe flavor of Fireball is unlike anything else. Even other cinnamon whiskies are difficult to compare. The drink goes down smooth, and as the branding will have you know, it's fiery. It's warming in the belly and flavorful on the tongue. You'll get the flavor of a cinnamon candy with all the spicy and sweet tones that you've always loved.\\n\\nThere are a ton of ways to drink Fireball Whisky, depending on your mood and preferences. If you're in the mood for the whisky itself, you can take it as a shot or drink it on the rocks. For many, however, the strong flavor of Fireball is hard to take straight. Luckily, there are so many outstanding mixed drinks you can make with Fireball that you'll have tons of options to choose from.\\n\\nEnhance your cider drink with Fireball. Add a shot of Fireball to a pint of your favorite hard cider for an awesome cinnamon taste. The most commonly suggested cider for this drink is Angry Orchard Crisp Apple Cider, but any cider will work.\\n\\nTry a mixed shot for something a little different. Combine Fireball and coffee liqueur in a shot glass for a spicy coffee flavor. If you're in the mood for a fizzy drink, combine one part Fireball and three parts Dr. Pepper for a Hot Pepper. The fireball helps bring out all the other flavors in the soda, making it a fun drink.\\n\\nBuy Fireball Cinnamon Whisky online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

An authentic silver tequila, Especial Silver is masterfully balanced to bring out its caramel, agave and herbal tones.\\n\\nEven if you're new to silver tequila, you've heard the name Jose Cuervo. The company boasts the largest agave holdings on the planet. Jose Cuervo agave is nestled in rich, volcanic soil and allowed to grow for seven years to reach maturity. After harvesting and pruning, the agave is sent to the famous La Rojeña distillery, which has been around since 1812. Each day, the oven deck at La Rojeña receives up to 300 tons of agave to produce Jose Cuervo tequila.\\n\\nUnlike most of Jose Cuervo's tequilas, Especial Silver remains unaged and contains at least 51 percent agave. The remaining liquid consists of sugarcane spirit. It's bottled immediately after distillation to maintain its pleasantly balanced aromas. The taste is light and mild, showcasing a blend of acidity and sweetness, which allows for easy drinking and mixing. \\n\\nSince Jose Cuervo Especial Silver has a clean, light taste, it's great for shots, especially if you want to follow it up with a chaser. The best way to enjoy Especial Silver, however, is in a cocktail. Use it to make the brand's delicious Cuervo Margarita, which is two parts Especial Silver, ice and one part each of triple sec and lime juice. Talk about delicious!\\xa0\\n\\nBuy Jose Cuervo Silver online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick\\'s Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\\n\\nHendrick\\'s is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick\\'s as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\\n\\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\\n\\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets.

(Two or three should do the trick.) \\nThis specific brand is named after Angostura, the Venezuelan town where they were first produced. The recipe is a closely guarded secret, with just five people knowing the exact formula. Angostura bitters were first used to soothe soldiers’ upset stomachs and are believed to have other healing benefits but we’re pretty sure your bottle will spend more time on your bar cart than in your medicine cabinet.',\n",

The result is a flowery and fruity aroma that lends itself to a diverse mix of flavors. If only most brothers could put their minds to such good use instead of fighting!\\n\\nFull and fleshy on the tongue, Lillet Blanc offers a mishmash of tastes including candied oranges, honey and pine resin. At 17 percent ABV, it's a bit stronger than most wines, but without being classified as a fortified wine.\\n\\nLillet Blanc is the classy drink that many people don't know exists. It's an excellent choice for a pre-dinner beverage, making a toast or paired with brunch. Drinking it on the rocks can bring out all the exotic fruits that go into its production, while an orange garnish adds a splash of color to the mix.\\n\\nWhile Lillet Blanc is terrific on the rocks, the Vesper is a real show stopper.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\\n\\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\\n\\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older añejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\\n\\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\\n\\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

The drink was first produced in the 1980s, and over the years, it slowly became popular in Canada and outside the country.\\n\\nWhen it was first made, Fireball was one of Seagram's several flavored schnapps drinks. In 1989, Sazerac\\xa0Company purchased the rights to the formula and the brand from Seagram. At first, Sazerac branded this as Dr. McGillicuddy's Fireball Whisky. It wasn't until years later in 2007 that the drink was re-branded to the Fireball Cinnamon Whisky most people now recognize.\\n\\nThe flavor of Fireball is unlike anything else. Even other cinnamon whiskies are difficult to compare. The drink goes down smooth, and as the branding will have you know, it's fiery. It's warming in the belly and flavorful on the tongue. You'll get the flavor of a cinnamon candy with all the spicy and sweet tones that you've always loved.\\n\\nThere are a ton of ways to drink Fireball Whisky, depending on your mood and preferences. If you're in the mood for the whisky itself, you can take it as a shot or drink it on the rocks. For many, however, the strong flavor of Fireball is hard to take straight. Luckily, there are so many outstanding mixed drinks you can make with Fireball that you'll have tons of options to choose from.\\n\\nEnhance your cider drink with Fireball. Add a shot of Fireball to a pint of your favorite hard cider for an awesome cinnamon taste. The most commonly suggested cider for this drink is Angry Orchard Crisp Apple Cider, but any cider will work.\\n\\nTry a mixed shot for something a little different. Combine Fireball and coffee liqueur in a shot glass for a spicy coffee flavor. If you're in the mood for a fizzy drink, combine one part Fireball and three parts Dr. Pepper for a Hot Pepper. The fireball helps bring out all the other flavors in the soda, making it a fun drink.\\n\\nBuy Fireball Cinnamon Whisky online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable –\\xa0just not in a predictable way.\\n\\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\\n\\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\\n\\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\\n\\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\\n\\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\\n\\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan. Buy Maker’s Mark Whisky online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

There is little to no aftertaste, making this a great option for mixing or drinking by itself.\\n\\nOne of the best things about Milagro Silver Tequila is that it goes down smooth and doesn't burn like many other tequilas out there. However, there is a strong smell so if you have trouble with the scent of agave, you might want to plug your nose.\\n\\nTequila is made from the blue agave plant and is distilled for varying amounts of time, depending on the type of tequila and the maker's preference. According to the laws in Mexico, tequila is only allowed to be produced in and around Jalisco, and select other areas. While the alcohol content can range between 31 percent and 55 percent alcohol content, it generally sits around 38 percent.\\n\\nWhile you can drink this tequila by itself, it also pairs well with a huge variety of other drinks to give you outstanding cocktails.\\n\\nGo for something classic with a margarita. Combine two parts Milagro Silver, three-quarters parts agave nectar or simple syrup and one-part lime juice for a refreshing drink. Another great standard tequila drink to try is the tequila sunrise.

This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant & Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand\\'s Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick\\'s Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\\n\\nHendrick\\'s is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick\\'s as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\\n\\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\\n\\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon\\'s Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper. If that\\'s too ambitious, try a simple Gin & Tonic using Hendrick\\'s.\\n\\nBuy Hendrick’s Gin online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick up in store.',\n",

This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant & Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand\\'s Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick\\'s Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\\n\\nHendrick\\'s is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick\\'s as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\\n\\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\\n\\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon\\'s Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper.

He became the first to export tequila to the rest of the world, and today, Sauza offers a full line of tequila. Sauza® Silver, one of the pioneer spirits from the brand, is double distilled in copper pot stills at low proof to retain the full agave flavor.

Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur.

Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick.

       "  'Baileys Irish Cream Original': {'description': \"What kind of cows make your liquor? This is an important question for the makers of Bailey's Irish Cream. Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \\n\\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick. Bailey's is an infinitely usable bar pantry ingredient you should always have around. Don’t wait, buy Bailey’s Original Irish Cream through Drizly at a great price and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Originally a celebratory drink for hunters (hence the \"jäger\"), it\\'s the ideal drink to mark every big win — or even a well-deserved weekend. Jäger is 70 proof, so you know this liqueur means business.\\n\\nA true classic, the Jägermeister recipe hasn\\'t changed since it was first made in 1878 in Wolfenbüttel, Germany. This dark-colored liqueur is made with 56 different herbs and spices, including licorice, anise, ginger, juniper berries and citrus peel. The herb and spice blend is steeped in water and alcohol, and its aged in oak barrels for a year. Then it\\'s mixed with sugar and alcohol before it\\'s bottled and shipped right to your front door.\\n\\nEven the Jägermeister bottle is custom. As the story goes, distiller Curt Mast and his buddies spent a lot of time hunting and needed a bottle that could stand up to their outdoorsy lifestyle. Mast did what anyone would do and dropped a bunch of bottles on the floor until he found a shape that held up to his tests.\\n\\nThere\\'s no whiskey in Jäger, but nothing\\'s stopping you from adding a little. In fact, some fans prefer to pair the herbal liqueur with whiskey or rum. The easiest way to enjoy Jägermeister is in the form of an ice-cold shot, preferably chilled to zero degrees. But if you\\'re more of a cocktail fan, try a Jäger Tonic with tonic water, citrus zest and ice.\\n\\nBuy Jägermeister online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door.',\n",

From Tokyo to London to Louisville, Jim Beam sets the benchmark for what a bourbon should be, aged twice as long as required by law for a flavor that's unlike any other. Distilled with corn, malted barley, time, pride and passion, there's a reason why Jim Beam Bourbon is on almost every bar shelf. However, it isn't the name that should entice you. Opening a bottle is the best way to celebrate life events, gatherings, or just hanging out with friends. It's as versatile as it is smooth, something you've probably always aspired to be, yet it does so effortlessly.\\n\\nTo get the distinct flavor of Jim Beam Bourbon, the distillery ages the liquor in charred oak barrels for a minimum of four years. This imparts a medium body and a caramel color that you've come to know in a bourbon. The oaky, vanilla and spicy backdrop greets you with a swirling of the bourbon, inviting you to taste what lies within the glass. When you finally raise the glass, your taste buds become overwhelmed with a five-pronged attack of sweetness, grain, oak, char and fruit. Most five-pronged attacks are best left to the battlefield or sporting event, but this bludgeons you over the head with flavors that keep you coming back. Enjoy Jim Beam Bourbon on the rocks, with a splash of water or in one of your favorite cocktails.\",\n",

The extra aging draws more flavor and sugar from the wood, providing a full-bodied, fruity flavor with hints of grass and grain. It's 100-proof, which is considered the honest age of bourbons made a century ago. The Beam family makes this spirit with extra char on white oak barrels for a bigger flavor.\\n\\nKnob Creek Bourbon is comfortable on the top shelf of any home bar. You should put it right up there with the best names from Tennessee, Ireland, Canada or Scotland. It's a great dessert after a grilled steak and is at home with a cigar next to your ash tray.\\n\\nHow does it mix? Its bold, organic flavor stands up well in cocktails if you must mix it. Fresh mint and a hint of sugar make a fine Julep. It makes a nice old fashioned with orange, bitters and a cherry. The family suggests you try a new fashioned. Instead of sugar, use Amaretto as a sweetener. Mix that with bitters and an orange peel. Serve it up or on the rocks.\\n\\nWhatever you do, taste it with a little extra patience.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable –\\xa0just not in a predictable way.\\n\\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\\n\\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\\n\\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\\n\\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\\n\\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\\n\\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Its history is simple enough: The founder wanted a better-tasting martini, which naturally meant starting with a better vodka. Thanks to SKYY's process, the brand has eliminated most of the vodka's impurities for an award-winning flavor that's remained unchanged for more than 20 years.\\n\\nSince SKYY was born out of the need to craft the perfect martini, we recommend you start there. Shake four ounces of SKYY vodka in a metal shaker with lots of ice until it is chilled, then pour into a martini glass and garnish with olives. Drink it right away for the best experience, and add a couple teaspoons of olive juice for a dirty version.\\n\\nHosting a party and want to serve something distinctive and elegant? Go with a Savoy.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable –\\xa0just not in a predictable way.\\n\\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\\n\\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\\n\\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\\n\\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\\n\\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\\n\\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\\n\\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean. Thanks to these ingredients, the flavor profile evokes visions of white sand beaches, palm trees and crystal-clear ocean waters. Even if you can only fill a kiddie pool to sit in, Bacardi Superior Rum takes you away from it all.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

This Mexican liquor is a little harder to find than tequila and other options, but Del Maguey has made its Vida Mezcal easy to get and at an entry-level price. It tastes delicious in mixed drinks and will introduce you to the world of mezcal.\\n\\nThis mezcal is distilled twice and hand-crafted. Del Maguey uses wood-fired copper stills, which bring out fruity aromas and other sweet notes such as honey and vanilla. On your palate, experience cinnamon, banana, tangerine and even sandalwood.\\n\\nWondering why you should opt for mezcal over tequila? Both mezcal and tequila are Mexican liquors distilled from the agave plant. Mezcal and tequila come from different regions in Mexico and often from different varieties of agave plant. Tequila must come from the Blue Agave plant, while mezcal can come from any agave plant. Most mezcal comes from Agave Espadin, including the Del Maguey Vida variety.\\n\\nThough you can try sipping Del Maguey Vida Mezcal to understand what mezcal is and how it should taste, this mezcal is designed to taste delicious in cocktails. The fruit notes and long finish make it perfect for fruitier mixes, such as a Sierra Madre Sunrise, which is made of mezcal plus Aperol, chocolate bitters and lemon juice. Try making a Mezcal Julep with basil and cranberry for a fruity twist on the classic. Remember to use quality juices and ripe fruits for best results.\\n\\nBuy Del Maguey Vida Mezcal online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.',\n",

Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \\n\\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick. Bailey's is an infinitely usable bar pantry ingredient you should always have around. Don’t wait, buy Bailey’s Original Irish Cream through Drizly at a great price and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Sauza® Signature Blue Silver Tequila is a 100% agave tequila complemented by an added herbal dimension for a consistently smooth flavor. Bright silver with crystal hints, the aroma of this tequila offers a balance of agave and herbal notes with hints of spice while agave and citrus flavors can be tasted on the palate. The short finish also has a warm, balanced body. Ideal for margaritas.\\n\\nWinner of Gold Medal at the 2017 SIP\\xa0Awards',\n",

Because of the strong flavor bitters are added to drinks in dashes.

The recipe is a closely guarded secret, with just five people knowing the exact formula.

Originally, Boissiere was a French brand of vermouth made in the Chambéry region; in 1971, seeking a new home, the brand relocated to the other side of Mont Blanc to Turin, Italy. So, this vermouth can claim two of the “capitols” of vermouth as it home. Vermouth begins with a neutral, dry white wine (generally) which is then blended with an eau de vie that has been infused with a special selection of herbs, flowers, fruit peels, seeds, plants and whatever botanicals are needed to achieve its specific and distinct attributes. The addition of the eau de vie infused with the 'singular botanical recipe' into the wine makes vermouth an 'aromatized'-'fortified' wine. With sweet vermouth, caramelized sugar is then added to achieve desired sweetness and color. In Boissiere, the aromas start at clean flowers, marjoram, coriander, citrus, chamomile, cake, clove, herbal and hints of nutmeg. The flavor articulately follows the aromas awash in a well integrated sweetness. All of this leads to a lean, fresh finish. Try this in any cocktail that calls for sweet vermouth, with soda water, on ice, with a twist or neat with a meal.\",\n",

He became the first to export tequila to the rest of the world, and today, Sauza offers a full line of tequila. Sauza® Gold, one of the pioneer spirits from the brand, is double distilled in copper pot stills at low proof to retain the full agave flavor.

It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\\n\\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\\n\\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older añejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\\n\\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\\n\\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

He became the first to export tequila to the rest of the world, and today, Sauza offers a full line of tequila.

Because of the strong flavor bitters are added to drinks in dashes. (Two or three should do the trick.) \\nThis specific brand is named after Angostura, the Venezuelan town where they were first produced. The recipe is a closely guarded secret, with just five people knowing the exact formula. Angostura bitters were first used to soothe soldiers’ upset stomachs and are believed to have other healing benefits but we’re pretty sure your bottle will spend more time on your bar cart than in your medicine cabinet.',\n",

This small-batch gin is produced by William Grant & Sons and infused with cucumber, rose and traditional juniper at the brand\\'s Scottish distillery. Small batches are typically defined as 1,000 liters or fewer, but Hendrick\\'s Gin is crafted in tiny 500-liter batches, giving the master distiller more control over her artistry.\\n\\nHendrick\\'s is the result of combining two different spirits from rare and unusual stills: the Bennet still and the Carter-Head still. The exceptionally smooth gin features a nice balance of subtle flavors, which include wonderful notes of flowers, fruits, roots and seeds from across the world. In fact, the Wall Street Journal has described Hendrick\\'s as the \"Best Gin in the World.\"\\n\\nWilliam Grant & Sons suggests serving the gin over ice with tonic water. Garnish with a cucumber slice instead of the traditional lemon wedge. Another great option is to serve the gin with soda water and a bit of elderflower.\\n\\nYou can also create an odd variety of cocktails with distinctive bouquets. Gordon\\'s Cup is a sour-and-salty concoction that marries cucumber, salt and pepper, lime juice and freshly ground salt and pepper. If that\\'s too ambitious, try a simple Gin & Tonic using Hendrick\\'s.\\n\\nBuy Hendrick’s Gin online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick up in store.',\n",

There is little to no aftertaste, making this a great option for mixing or drinking by itself.\\n\\nOne of the best things about Milagro Silver Tequila is that it goes down smooth and doesn't burn like many other tequilas out there. However, there is a strong smell so if you have trouble with the scent of agave, you might want to plug your nose.\\n\\nTequila is made from the blue agave plant and is distilled for varying amounts of time, depending on the type of tequila and the maker's preference. According to the laws in Mexico, tequila is only allowed to be produced in and around Jalisco, and select other areas. While the alcohol content can range between 31 percent and 55 percent alcohol content, it generally sits around 38 percent.\\n\\nWhile you can drink this tequila by itself, it also pairs well with a huge variety of other drinks to give you outstanding cocktails.\\n\\nGo for something classic with a margarita. Combine two parts Milagro Silver, three-quarters parts agave nectar or simple syrup and one-part lime juice for a refreshing drink. Another great standard tequila drink to try is the tequila sunrise. Mix one-part tequila, one-third part grenadine and two-thirds part orange juice.\\n\\nBuy Milagro Silver Tequila online at a great price through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Though Smirnoff Ice is a relative newcomer for the brand, it's a winner that looks like it's here to stay.\\n\\nThough the good folks at Smirnoff make Smirnoff Ice, this bottled beverage isn't made with vodka. It's a malt beverage, so the brewing process is similar to the process for making beer. The malt gives Smirnoff Ice a light, fruity flavor that's on the sweet side.

It tastes delicious in mixed drinks and will introduce you to the world of mezcal.\\n\\nThis mezcal is distilled twice and hand-crafted. Del Maguey uses wood-fired copper stills, which bring out fruity aromas and other sweet notes such as honey and vanilla. On your palate, experience cinnamon, banana, tangerine and even sandalwood.\\n\\nWondering why you should opt for mezcal over tequila? Both mezcal and tequila are Mexican liquors distilled from the agave plant. Mezcal and tequila come from different regions in Mexico and often from different varieties of agave plant. Tequila must come from the Blue Agave plant, while mezcal can come from any agave plant. Most mezcal comes from Agave Espadin, including the Del Maguey Vida variety.\\n\\nThough you can try sipping Del Maguey Vida Mezcal to understand what mezcal is and how it should taste, this mezcal is designed to taste delicious in cocktails. The fruit notes and long finish make it perfect for fruitier mixes, such as a Sierra Madre Sunrise, which is made of mezcal plus Aperol, chocolate bitters and lemon juice. Try making a Mezcal Julep with basil and cranberry for a fruity twist on the classic.

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

The finish is zesty and fresh, lingering on the tongue with its citrusy aromas and characteristic herbaceous notes. The long-established Wairau Valley and its neighboring Awatere Valley are situated at the northeastern tip of the South Island, a dry, sunny region that produces most of New Zealand's wine. This region features fast-draining loams that are ideal for growing grapes. In fact, the area is particularly famous for its zesty, pungent Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. Vines are varied in age, bringing a mix of youthful vigor and a mature depth of flavor to each bottle of Kim Crawford Sauvignon Blanc. It's no wonder the wine has garnered high marks from some of the world's most important wine critics.\\n\\nExpect a light straw color with yellow and green hues to match the herbaceous and tropical qualities of the wine. Each sip brings forth a plethora of fruit flavors, including apricot, nectarine, passion fruit and honeysuckle. Best of all, the wine continues to develop from one to three years after bottling, only getting better with age. As such, it's a wonderful wine to drink anytime with friends or simply when you want to reward yourself after a long day. Pair it with asparagus, fresh oysters, summer salads or lobster to highlight the flavors and savor an unbeatable experience.\",\n",

The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

Our handcrafted technique offers more  control over the distillation process, resulting in a spectacularly clean product of incomparable excellence.  Only the heart of the run, \"the nectar\" is taken, leaving behind residual higher and lower alcohols.

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable –\\xa0just not in a predictable way.\\n\\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\\n\\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\\n\\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\\n\\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\\n\\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\\n\\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan. Buy Maker’s Mark Whisky online at a great price on Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

In this year, founder Don Facundo Bacardi purchased the land in Cuba that would become the distillery that changed the way the world drank rum. By pioneering charcoal filtration and purposeful aging, Bacardi created Bacardi white rum, which set the standard for flavor and balance. However, it wasn't without hardship. The Cuban Revolution forced Bacardi from Cuba, and today, the Cathedral of Rum is in Puerto Rico. It still imparts all the distillation processes that make it the world's top-selling rum brand, and the stuff that every rapper and pop icon seems to consider the ultimate party accompaniment.\\n\\nWith its unique balance and light taste, Bacardi Superior pairs beautifully with mint and lime without being overly dominant in the cocktail. This means that it's perfect for a mojito or a Cuba Libre, but without the overwhelming taste of alcohol. The reason for this wonderful marriage lies in the undertones of the rum, which imparts flavors such as citrus, coriander and ginger. Each batch of Bacardi White Rum gets these flavors thanks to the highest-quality ingredients, including sugar cane and yeasts that are only found in the Caribbean. Thanks to these ingredients, the flavor profile evokes visions of white sand beaches, palm trees and crystal-clear ocean waters. Even if you can only fill a kiddie pool to sit in, Bacardi Superior Rum takes you away from it all.\",\n",

It was originally made to celebrate the anniversary of Mexican independence, before reposado was even a thing. The rest is history, and more than six decades later, Hornitos Reposado is beloved by shot takers and margarita lovers around the globe.\\n\\nWhat goes into a bottle of Hornitos Reposado? This tequila is made from 100 percent blue agave, which is baked in small ovens, mashed, fermented and double-distilled. This pale straw-colored tequila ages for anywhere from two months to a year, typically in former bourbon barrels, before being bottled. Hornitos Reposado is 80-proof, so this tequila definitely packs a punch.\\n\\nAs a reposado, this tequila is somewhere between the non-aged blancos and the much older añejos. It has a fine agave aroma with some notes of green apple, and you'll also taste hints of apple and herbs. Hornitos Reposado is known as a mellow, full-bodied tequila with plenty of warmth, but don't let that fool you.\\n\\nSo, what's the best way to drink Hornitos Reposado? Shots, shots, shots, of course! Hornitos Reposado is ideal for tequila shots, as it's easy to drink, and the flavor isn't too complex. It's also great for mixing into classic tequila drinks. Try it in a margarita, with agave syrup, lime juice and a salt rim. If you're feeling fruity, try your Hornitos Reposado in a colorful tequila sunrise, with orange juice and grenadine syrup.\\n\\nBuy Hornitos Reposado online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

First produced in 1872, this golden-colored French wine was the harmonious blend of an idea from the Lillet brothers and some of the finest fruits from across the globe. The result is a flowery and fruity aroma that lends itself to a diverse mix of flavors. If only most brothers could put their minds to such good use instead of fighting!\\n\\nFull and fleshy on the tongue, Lillet Blanc offers a mishmash of tastes including candied oranges, honey and pine resin. At 17 percent ABV, it's a bit stronger than most wines, but without being classified as a fortified wine.\\n\\nLillet Blanc is the classy drink that many people don't know exists. It's an excellent choice for a pre-dinner beverage, making a toast or paired with brunch. Drinking it on the rocks can bring out all the exotic fruits that go into its production, while an orange garnish adds a splash of color to the mix.\\n\\nWhile Lillet Blanc is terrific on the rocks, the Vesper is a real show stopper. Made with gin, vodka and Lillet Blanc, it's the preferred beverage of James Bond in both books and film. It's not guaranteed to turn you into a suave secret agent, but at least you can try your hand at the accent.\\n\\nBuy Lillet Blanc online at a great price through Drizly to enjoy a glass of this great tasting aperitif.\",\n",

Simply combine our bourbon whiskey with cloves, lemon juice, brown sugar and hot water for a comforting Hot Toddy.\\n\\nBulleit Bourbon is still distilled and aged in the Bulleit family tradition. High rye content gives it a bold, spicy character with a distinctively smooth, clean finish. Kentucky limestone-filtered water provides a foundation for the bourbon's character, while charred American oak barrels lend a smoky backbone. Please drink responsibly.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

Pies, teas, jams…for a few months a year, it seems like it’s everywhere and in everything. The roots of the Keystone State’s rhubarbiness go all the way back to our favorite insanely industrious and pioneering founding father, Ben Franklin.    Aside from leading a revolution and discovering electricity, Franklin was an avid agriculturalist and best friend of botanist John Bartram. In fact, Franklin brought the first rhubarb seeds from Europe to America as a gift for Mr. Bartram in 1771. (Bartram’s Garden in Philadelphia is America’s oldest botanical garden. If you haven’t visited, you really should.) Point in fact, rhubarb originally came from China, where it was used as an herbal tonic. In the late 18th century, cane sugar became more affordable, which changed the way rhubarb was enjoyed.    Upon discovering the capacity of sugar to release the wonders of the plant’s intrinsic flavor, rhubarb migrated from a fold tonic to a tasty treat. Legend has it, Bartram was so enthused with rhubarb, he concocted a lovely garden tea showcasing his new botanical prize. We were mulling over this story when we came up with the idea of creating our own Art in the Age garden spirit in Mr. Bartram’s honor.    We are proud to offer you RHUBARB Tea! RHUBARB Tea features a botanical bounty of beets, carrots, lemons, petitgrain, cardamom, pure cane sugar, and of course, Bartram’s prize rhubarb. All organically certified and delicious. A confident 80 proof spirit that’s tangy but not too tangy–sweet, but not too sweet. Crisp and refreshing, but with a hint of spice. We guarantee there’s never been anything else like it…at least not since 1771. (Oh, and just to let you know, finding a source for organically certified rhubarb was quite a feat, so please savor every drop.)',\n",

The predominant flavor and aroma of a modern gin will always come from juniper (dried berries of the “common juniper,” Juniperus communis). But the wonderful challenge for the distiller is in selecting and blending from a wide variety of additional, exotic botanicals in order to impart a uniquely satisfying, balanced character to his gin. At Anchor Distilling we have taken delight in the adventure of researching and experimenting with many such botanicals.

The recipe was developed in collaboration with historian, author, and mixologist extraordinaire David Wondrich. Old Tom is the Gin for mixing classic cocktails dating from the days before prohibition. Its subtle maltiness is the result of using a base wort of malted barley, combined with an infusion of botanicals in high proof corn spirits. The final distillation is run through an alambic pot still in order to preserve the maximum amount of aromatics, flavor and body. Only the \"heart of the hearts\" (the very best portion of distillate) is retained for this special bottling.',\n",

The taste and purity of the water gave rise to the name of their spirits. They use the Rocky Mountain spring water in their spirits, which they believe gives a unique quality to their flavor. While the label is owned by Spring 44 Distilling Company, the filing with the federal Tax and Trade Bureau (as of 2012) locates the source as the Temperance Distilling Company of Michigan, which we have noted here as the producer. Presumably, the recipe and water are delivered via Spring 44 for bottling in Michigan (prior filings suggest an Oregon source with Side Pocket Beverage).    Spring 44 Vodka is made from what they describe as a \"proprietary blend of American-grown grain.\" It is filtered through a special \"virgin coconut\" carbon (charcoal) process (we don\\'t quite know what a \"virgin\" coconut is--is there a \"sullied\" coconut?--but guess it suggests not having been used in any other filtation process). They note that there is not one drop of \"munipal\" water in the vodka but 100% Rocky Mountain artesian water.    Spring 44 Honey Vodka is their flavored version, using \"all natural botanicals.\" It presents as a pale gold in the bottle.    In an extremely favorable review from Seattle PI, they called it \"flawless\" and \"delicious\" and summarized by saying, \"If you trust me on nothing else you read this year, trust me here: run out and find these bottles.\"',\n",

       "  'Campari': {'description': \"For over 150 years, Campari has been a favorite liqueur for drinkers with different tastes. The liquid is a dark red color and is often mixed with other alcohols and non-alcoholic drinks for cocktails. The drink was created in 1860.\\n \\nDepending on where the Campari is sold, the alcohol content ranges from 20.5 percent to 28 percent. When you smell Campari, you'll be reminded of pomegranate, strawberry, spicy herbs, bitter orange and cherry. The flavor starts off sweet and is followed by an herbal, spicy taste. After that, the bitterness of the drink starts to build. This is a wholly unique drink.\\n\\nThe recipe and creation process of Campari is still a secret to this day. Depending on your source, even the number of ingredients changes (ranging from 20 to 80). However, there are a few ingredients that are known. Campari includes fruits in water and alcohol as well as an infusion of herbs.\\n\\nThe most common ways to drink Campari are in cocktails, with prosecco or with soda water. While you can drink it neat, many have trouble with the bitter taste. Because of this, many of the mixed drinks that use Campari are strong flavored as well.\\n\\nThe most well-known drink using Campari is a Negroni. A Negroni can be served either straight up or on the rocks. All you need for this classic mixed drink is one ounce of dry gin, one ounce of Campari and one ounce of sweet vermouth. Mix these three together either in a mixing glass with ice or mix them right in the glass with some ice.\\n\\nAnother great Campari-based mixed drink is the Jasmine. In a cocktail shaker, combine one-and-a-half ounces of gin, three-quarters of an ounce of fresh-squeezed lemon juice, a quarter ounce of Campari and a quarter ounce of Cointreau. Fill the shaker with ice and shake for about 10 seconds. Strain your drink into a cocktail glass. Don't forget to add a lemon twist garnish for the perfect bold drink.\\n\\nBuy Campari online through Drizly and have it delivered directly to your door or pick it up in store.\",\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

The Bitter Truth Orange Bitters are a combination of bitter orange peel and several herbs and spices that are macerated in alcohol. The first orange bitters were released in the 1880s, a time when many classic cocktails such as the Martinez and Manhattan were created. Today they are still essential for the preparation of a Classic Martini Cocktail. The Bitter Truth Orange Bitters can be combined with all kinds of spirits such as Whisk(e)y, Rum, Vodka and Gin.    Tasting Notes:  The fruity sweetness at the beginning is quickly followed by a very bitter taste.

(Two or three should do the trick.) \\nThis specific brand is named after Angostura, the Venezuelan town where they were first produced. The recipe is a closely guarded secret, with just five people knowing the exact formula. Angostura bitters were first used to soothe soldiers’ upset stomachs and are believed to have other healing benefits but we’re pretty sure your bottle will spend more time on your bar cart than in your medicine cabinet.',\n",

To gather the elderflowers needed to distill St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, a team of 40 to 50 workers head to the French countryside and pick the blossoms of the beautiful flower. The window for picking the flowers is short, lasting only a few weeks in the spring. The rush to pick the blossoms resembles a last-minute rush by boyfriends or husbands to grab a fresh bouquet on Valentine's Day, but St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur boasts more satisfied recipients. Once picked, a race starts to begin the distillation process as the delicate flavors begin to dissipate only a short time after harvest.\\nThe elderflowers undergo a maceration process that accentuates and perpetuates their delicate flavor and aroma. The process has taken over 100 years to perfect, which makes mastery of video games look far less impressive. Workers mix the elderflower blossoms with a small amount of citrus fruits and cane sugar to heighten the subtle flavor, but the result is nothing short of spectacular. It is a delicate, balanced liqueur that delivers hints of pear, apricot, lychee and grapefruit zest. Despite the fruit presence, it has a bit of tartness to balance it out. It's not exactly like a liquid Sweet Tart, and only an actual taste gives you the sense of its true flavor. Mix it with champagne or other cocktails for some added sweetness, or enjoy it on its own for a mind-blowing after dinner cocktail.\",\n",

Nearly 40,000 top-bred Irish dairy cows contribute cream to make the world's most popular liqueur. It's blended with pure Irish whiskey and a proprietary cocoa extract to make one of the best-selling alcoholic beverages on the planet. \\n\\nWhat can you mix it with? Nothing and practically anything. All by itself, perhaps on the rocks, it makes a smooth sipper. It's very friendly with coffee, hot cocoa and other liqueurs. Amaretto, peppermint schnapps, cinnamon liqueur or whiskey all get along nicely with Bailey's in a hot drink.\\n\\nBecause of its weight and viscosity, Bailey's performs well with layered drinks. Building a multilayer shot takes some practice and touch, but it's an old-school skill that will wow your guests. Consider the classic B-52 coffee with Kahlua and Grand Marnier. While nice on the rocks or with coffee, the B-52 was originally intended to be a layered shot.\\n\\nTo craft one, you must add ingredients in the proper order. It's Kahlua, Bailey's then Grand Marnier. You need a tool to gently add the ingredients without stirring things up. Some use the back of a spoon or a classic twisted swizzle stick. Bailey's is an infinitely usable bar pantry ingredient you should always have around.

The result is a flowery and fruity aroma that lends itself to a diverse mix of flavors. If only most brothers could put their minds to such good use instead of fighting!\\n\\nFull and fleshy on the tongue, Lillet Blanc offers a mishmash of tastes including candied oranges, honey and pine resin. At 17 percent ABV, it's a bit stronger than most wines, but without being classified as a fortified wine.\\n\\nLillet Blanc is the classy drink that many people don't know exists. It's an excellent choice for a pre-dinner beverage, making a toast or paired with brunch. Drinking it on the rocks can bring out all the exotic fruits that go into its production, while an orange garnish adds a splash of color to the mix.\\n\\nWhile Lillet Blanc is terrific on the rocks, the Vesper is a real show stopper. Made with gin, vodka and Lillet Blanc, it's the preferred beverage of James Bond in both books and film. It's not guaranteed to turn you into a suave secret agent, but at least you can try your hand at the accent.\\n\\nBuy Lillet Blanc online at a great price through Drizly to enjoy a glass of this great tasting aperitif.\",\n",

Bill Samuels bought the Burks' Distillery in Loretto, Kentucky, in 1953 and did the predictable –\\xa0just not in a predictable way.\\n\\nHe wanted to select the right mashbill for his new Bourbon. He took inspiration from the Old Fitzgerald and W. L. Weller recipes made by Pappy Van Winkle. He did not want to take the time to distill, age and taste each candidate, so he made a loaf of bread from each mix of grain. One had no rye in it.\\n\\nNo rye? Samuels liked the loaf without the rye best so he ran with it. The winner contained the customary corn with malted barley and a large dose of red winter wheat. The product is in stark contrast to rye-heavy spirits like Bulleit or Knob Creek.\\n\\nThe result is less spicy than the rye-influenced whiskeys. Bring a glass to your nose. You'll smell spiced honey, cut fruit and citrus peel. Have a sip. Barley malt, butterscotch and vanilla bean will gradually bloom on your tongue. Wait a moment. The finish is of medium length with gentle caramel and dry oak spice.\\n\\nThis collection of flavors makes Maker's Mark very friendly with sweet vermouth. It makes a fine Manhattan with a cherry. Go light with the bitters. It's also a great choice with an Old Fashioned, particularly if you have dark purple Bing cherries to muddle.\\n\\nIf you're feeling funky, ask yourself two questions. Does bourbon like peaches? Both are as southern as sassafras. Does peach like orange? Of course, or we'd have no Fuzzy Navel. Bring all three together. Add 1 1/2 ounces of Maker's with 3/4 of an ounce peach schnapps to an ounce of OJ. Shake that well and then serve it up or on the rocks. There's a navel with some extra fuzz.\\n\\nFor your home bar (depending on your budget and the height of your top shelf) Maker's Mark makes a fine everyday house bourbon or a special occasion sipper to put next to your best bottles from Scotland, Ireland and Japan.

The bubbles and grapefruit flavors mix eloquently, but with a kicker that can surely spice up a brunch or wedding shower.\\n\\nIf you want a fresh take on a traditional cocktail, put Deep Eddy Ruby Red on the rocks with a bit of club soda.

      "One of the finest and oldest cocktails, the Manhattan is truly a classic cocktail. It is a simple drink recipe that requires just a few ingredients. You can choose between rye whiskey and bourbon, though some drinkers still prefer a smooth Canadian whisky. There is no doubt, however, that this is one of the essential whiskey cocktails that everyone should know.\n",
      "As with the gin martini, there are many ways that you can adapt the Manhattan to your personal taste. It has also inspired countless variations, but before you give those a taste, it's best to start off with the original. Even though it is an easy cocktail, there are a number of choices to be made and it all begins with deciding which whiskey to pour.\n",
      "No matter how you mix up your Manhattan, you will find that it's an ideal drink for any occasion. It is perfect for a dinner party and pairs nicely with a great variety of foods. It's also a fantastic drink for a casual night with friends.\n",
      "Gather the ingredients.\n",
      "Pour the ingredients into a mixing glass with ice cubes.\n",
      "Stir well.\n",
      "Strain into a chilled cocktail glass.\n",
      "Garnish with the cherry.\n",
      "The Manhattan has inspired countless cocktails over the years. You may also notice that many share only the whiskey in common with the original recipe. Just as the name \"martini\" is popular with fancy vodka and gin cocktails, and \"margarita\" is a common choice for tequila cocktails, \"Manhattan\" has become synonymous with nearly any whiskey cocktail that's served \"up.\"\n",
      "The original Manhattan was made with rye whiskey. However, there was a period of time in the 1900s when rye was not readily available or as high quality as the Manhattan requires.\n",
      "During these decades, it became common practice to use a Canadian whiskey. When bourbon began to reclaim headlines in the last decades of the 20th century, that became a popular choice and was the newly preferred whiskey for a Manhattan.\n",
      "The great news is that rye whiskey has made a comeback. Today we have a number of great ryes to choose from and we can once again get a taste of the original Manhattan.\n",
      "That said, the choice is ultimately yours because it is your drink. For a sweeter Manhattan, go with bourbon. When you're in the mood for a dry and semi-spicy Manhattan, rye whiskey would be the choice. On those days when a smooth, soft Manhattan sounds good, pick up a bottle of Canadian whiskey.\n",
      "When ordering a Manhattan at the bar, you may want to \"call\" your whiskey of choice. Most bars will have a house whiskey that they regularly use in the cocktail and it could be a rye, bourbon, or Canadian. You can always ask what they use and upgrade if you prefer something else.\n",
      "Be as specific as you like. For instance, you could either ask for a Maker's Mark Manhattan or a Bourbon Manhattan (in this case you will get the house bourbon).\n",
      "The Manhattan is much like the martini in that it requires a base spirit (whiskey or gin) with vermouth. The martini uses dry vermouth while the Manhattan uses sweet vermouth.\n",
      "This sweeter fortified wine works best with the majority of whiskeys. Yet, if you find the right whiskey, dry vermouth can be used to make a great drink as well. Woodford Reserve Bourbon is a great place to begin for your dry Manhattan experience.\n",
      "Again, like the martini, each drinker will have their preferred ratio of whiskey to vermouth. The 2:1 in the recipe above is a good starting point and the most common mix for the Manhattan. Many drinkers also prefer a 4:1 mix with just 1/2 ounce of sweet vermouth for 2 ounces of whiskey.\n",
      "Play around with this to find your personal idea of the perfect Manhattan. It's also likely that this will change depending on the particular whiskey you're pouring.\n",
      "Aromatic bitters have long been the preferred accent for the Manhattan and it should be considered a required ingredient. Since we use just a few dashes at a time, it can be easy to forget their importance. However, they are the finishing touch that brings cocktails like the Manhattan into perfect balance.\n",
      "There are a number of new bitters available today and you might want to explore their effects on your perfect Manhattan mix. Fee Brothers' Whiskey Barrel Aged, The Bitter Truth's Chocolate, and Bittermen's Xocolatl Mole are all great options for experimentation.\n",
      "The cherry is the customary garnish for most Manhattans, though an orange peel or twist works nicely as well.\n",
      "If you opt for a cherry, think about making your own maraschino cherries because those bright red maraschinos found at the liquor store are not as natural as you may think. In the least, pick up a high-end maraschino cherry like those from Luxardo or grab fresh cherries from the produce section whenever you see them.\n"
